# VKHotkeys - vk.com automation tool. Latest version is 3.2 (broken)

I have stopped to actively participate in this project development. Are there any other developers out there who wish to make listening to music on vk.com better?

Current version 3.2 has stopped working with the new design update on VK.com. Feel free to fix it and commit to github so we can all enjoy music on vk once again.
